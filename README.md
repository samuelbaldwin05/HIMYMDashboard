# HIMYMDashboard
This app is a dashboard created using the panel python library that allows users to visualize data from the show How I Met Your Mother. Visualizations include histograms, scatterplots, bar charts, box plots, line plots, and sankeys, each only taking in the proper data types for the given plot. Data includes natural language processed data that measures which character spoke the most in a given episode, the sentiment of the episode, and the number of times the character Barney says one of his catch phrases. Additionally data includes air date, director, writer, US viewer counts, and IMDB ratings for each episode.
